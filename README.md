# Hello everyone! It's a pleasure to have you here.

The main objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my hard skills in solving business challenges through my knowledge of Data Science. <br>

I am developing myself to execute all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from knowing the business issue to publishing the model on Clouds.

## Data Science Projects:

### Data Engineering Project

* **Business Problem:** Two businessmen, named Eduardo and Marcelo, wanted to start an e-commerce company called Star Jeans to sell men's jeans pants. The data scientist is responsible for determining the raw materials, types, colors, and best price to sell jeans pants.
* **Solution Strategy:** Using a script, the data was collected, cleaned up, and insert it into a database.
* **Business Result:** Based on the business criteria, a script is running to collect data from the website for a period. After that, the results will be analyze.

### The Crisp-DM Methodology

* **Business Problem:** A data science project must have a reliable and repeatable process to ensure easy follow-up and understanding by all teams. It is essential to know all the steps.
* **Solution:** I developed an online jupyter-book that describes in detail all the steps of CRISP-DM methodology.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

* **Business Problem:** House Rocket's business model consists of purchasing and reselling properties through a digital platform. The data scientist is responsible for developing an online dashboard to help the CEO company overview properties available on House Rocket's portfolio and find the best business opportunities.
* **Solution:** I specified which properties are recommendable to purchase or not, considering region, median price, and season. I developed an online dashboard on the Heroku platform, making it easy for the CEO to perform data visualization, helping to choose the business decisions to get a high profit.
* **Business Result:** On the best option, the company must buy 11877 properties resulting in a US$1,420,125,681.90 profit.
